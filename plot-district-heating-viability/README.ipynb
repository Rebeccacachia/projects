    "To fully reproduce the pipeline the user must:\n",
    "- Have access to the codema-dev s3 to access the underlying Codema-only datasets - *i.e. they need an authenticated AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY*\n",
    "- Be comfortable enough with the command line to create a conda environment from an `environment.yml` and run the pipeline with `python pipeline.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "To open up this methodology to the public the pipeline could be adapted to default to public data if it can't connect to s3, however, this would only be worthwhile if a UI entrypoint to the ETL was created to mitigate the need for command line usage"
